# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This is a single-context repo.

Use:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for project/domain language.
- `docs/adr/` at the repo root for architectural decisions.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md`, if it exists.
- Relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/`, if they exist.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, either reconsider the terminology or note the gap for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
